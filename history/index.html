    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a non-linear, timeline-driven exploratory tool. The core navigation is a horizontal timeline representing the four major eras from the report. This structure was chosen over a linear scroll to empower users to jump between historical periods, facilitating comparison and thematic exploration. Clicking an era dynamically updates the main content view, presenting the detailed information for that period in a digestible format using cards, interactive diagrams, and focused case studies. This design prioritizes user-driven discovery and makes the dense historical information more accessible and engaging than a traditional text layout. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Forest Cover Trend (Line Chart): Report Info -> Deforestation/Reforestation trend. Goal -> Show change over time. Viz -> Chart.js Line Chart. Interaction -> Hover for tooltips. Justification -> Provides a powerful, overarching visual narrative of forest loss and recovery.
        - Dominant Influences (Bar Chart): Report Info -> Key human activities per era. Goal -> Compare influences across eras. Viz -> Chart.js Bar Chart. Interaction -> Clickable bars for navigation. Justification -> Acts as the primary interactive navigation, visually linking eras to their core drivers.
        - Ecosystem Services (Donut Chart): Report Info -> Four categories of ecosystem services. Goal -> Inform/Organize. Viz -> Chart.js Donut Chart. Interaction -> Hover to highlight segments. Justification -> A simple, effective way to visualize and explain the components of a key modern concept.
        - Key Concepts (Interactive Cards): Report Info -> Vocabulary list. Goal -> Inform. Method -> HTML/CSS/JS cards. Interaction -> Click to reveal definition. Justification -> De-clutters the main text and allows users to learn key terms on demand.
        - Case Studies (Styled HTML): Report Info -> Cahokia, Fur Trade, Passenger Pigeon. Goal -> Inform. Method -> Visually distinct HTML/CSS sections. Justification -> Highlights critical stories within the larger narrative, breaking up text with images and key stats.
