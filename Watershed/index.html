    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Forest Green, Moss Green, Tan, Off-white) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured around the three explicit sections provided in the source report (12.1, 12.2, 12.3). This thematic structure is the most logical for a textbook chapter, as it allows students to focus on one topic at a time. The primary interaction is a tab-based navigation system at the top, which shows/hides the content for the selected section. This is a familiar and intuitive UI pattern for educational content. Each section then uses a combination of introductory text, interactive HTML/CSS diagrams (to avoid SVG), and Chart.js visualizations to explain key concepts. This design directly supports the user's goal of learning the chapter content by breaking it down into manageable, interactive chunks. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        1.  Report Info: Chapter Sections (12.1, 12.2, 12.3). Goal: Organize. Viz/Method: HTML/Tailwind Tab Navigation. Interaction: Click to show/hide section content. Justification: Intuitive SPA navigation for thematic content. Library: Vanilla JS.
        2.  Report Info: Watershed Concepts. Goal: Inform/Organize. Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/Tailwind diagram of a watershed. Interaction: Click on zones (Riparian, Upland, Harvest) to show/hide text blurbs. Justification: Visualizes spatial relationships and impacts interactively without SVG. Library: Vanilla JS.
        3.  Report Info: Harvest Impact on Water Yield. Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: Chart.js Bar Chart. Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Clearly shows change between categories (pre/post-harvest). Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        4.  Report Info: Wildlife Habitat Layers. Goal: Inform/Organize. Viz/Method: Interactive HTML/Tailwind diagram (stacked divs). Interaction: Click on layers (Canopy, Understory, etc.) to show descriptive text. Justification: Simple, clear visualization of a vertical concept. Library: Vanilla JS.
        5.  Report Info: Habitat Suitability. Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: Chart.js Radar Chart. Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Effectively compares multiple attributes (food, cover, water) for different species or management scenarios. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        6.  Report Info: Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS). Goal: Organize/Compare. Viz/Method: HTML/Tailwind styled table. Interaction: Static display. Justification: A table/matrix is the clearest and most standard way to present the ROS framework. Library: HTML/Tailwind.
        7.  Report Info: Sustainable Trail Design. Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: HTML/Tailwind diagram. Interaction: Clickable hotspots for 'Switchback' and 'Water Bar' to show definitions. Justification: Illustrates physical design principles simply. Library: Vanilla JS.

                    This section explores how forestry practices are deeply connected to the health of our water resources. A watershed is an area of land that drains all its water to a common outlet, like a river or lake. Forest management can significantly affect both the quantity (yield) and quality of water flowing from these areas. We'll look at potential impacts and the "Best Management Practices" (BMPs) foresters use to protect water.

                            <strong>Upland Forest:</strong> Healthy, intact forests act like a sponge. Tree roots and forest floor litter help water infiltrate the soil slowly, which recharges groundwater, filters water naturally, and prevents rapid, flashy runoff that can cause erosion.

                            <strong>Harvest Area:</strong> Removing tree cover can increase water yield because less water is taken up by trees (transpiration). However, exposed soil is vulnerable to erosion. Building forest roads improperly is a major source of sediment, which can pollute streams.

                    Forests are more than just trees; they are complex ecosystems that provide habitat for countless wildlife species. Silviculture (the art and science of growing trees) can be a powerful tool to actively manage and enhance these habitats. This section explores how different forestry practices can be tailored to meet the needs (food, cover, water, and space) of specific wildlife.
